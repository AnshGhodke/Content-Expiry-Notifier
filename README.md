# Content-Expiry-Notifier
The goal of the project is to develop a user-friendly desktop application that helps users manage items with expiry dates. The application notifies users about items nearing their expiry and allows them to track and organize their inventory effectively. It includes a secure login system to ensure only authorized users can access the application.
